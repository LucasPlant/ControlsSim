# ControlSim

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A web-based dynamic systems and control simulation platform that enables users to visualize and interact with various control systems in real-time. Built with Python using the Dash framework and Plotly for interactive visualizations.

## Features

- Interactive system simulation in your web browser
- Real-time visualization of system dynamics
- Multiple controller implementations (PID, State Feedback, etc.)
- Various dynamic system models
- Built on top of modern Python frameworks (Dash, Plotly)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:LucasPlant/ControlsSim.git
   cd ControlsSim
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # TODO: Add requirements.txt or Docker setup
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python control_vis_app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the localhost address shown in the terminal.
